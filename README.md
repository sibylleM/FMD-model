# FMD-model
Source code for FMD model which runs on livestock movement networks and includes contact-tracing.
The model is implemented in Java and can be read into Netbeans or Eclipse.


The model is a spatial stochastic individual-based model of disease transmission and control. This model allows for mathematical modelling of between-premises spread of infectious diseases (e.g. foot-and-mouth disease). The framework was implemented in Java 7.1 and calls upon a graphical user interface (GUI) where you can:
    •	read in input files (.csv-files), 
    •	choose a spatial kernel, 
    •	set control-specific parameters.
