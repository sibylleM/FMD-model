# FMD-model
Source code for a foot-and-mouth disease model which runs on livestock movement networks and includes contact-tracing.
The model is implemented in Java and can be read into Netbeans or Eclipse.

The model is a spatial stochastic individual-based model of disease transmission and control. This model allows for mathematical modelling of between-premises spread of infectious diseases (e.g. foot-and-mouth disease). The framework was implemented in Java 7.1 and calls upon a graphical user interface (GUI) where you can (i) read in input files (.csv-files), 
(ii) choose a spatial kernel, (iii) set control-specific parameters.
